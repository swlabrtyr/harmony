**Hello everyone to my first blog post!**

This will be a collection of tutorials on web audio, interactive art and creative coding. Hope you learn some stuff, and if you don't then hope you teach me some stuff!

## Web Audio API

So what is Web Audio API and why should you care?

Well, if you are a web developer who wants interactive sound in an application, Web Audio API is what will get you there, and if you are a musician or artist who wants to use the web as a platform for your creativity, web audio provides you a rich set of features for expressing yourself using sound!
